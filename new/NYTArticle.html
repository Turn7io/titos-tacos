<p> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">Back to the Fold: From 
  Dot-Com to Dad and Mom</font></b></p>
<p> By ABBY ELLIN</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"> <font size="7">A</font>s a teenager growing up in Salem, Va., 
    John Reynolds spent his summers working at Reynolds Siding, a remodeling company 
    his parents have owned for more than three decades. He returned to work there 
    after college, but he soon grew restless.</p>
  <p align="left"> "I wanted to do something different, to live in a different 
    town and not work with my parents," said Mr. Reynolds, who is now 27. "I didn't 
    understand how the working world worked, the demands, that people are expected 
    to do work and have responsibilities. Also, having my parents as my bosses 
    — I didn't like that. They treated me like a kid." </p>
  <p align="left">In 1997, Mr. Reynolds left the family business to pursue a doctorate 
    in theology at Duke University; he hoped to teach some day. But a year later, 
    he changed his mind again and decided to work as a clerk for a law firm in 
    Richmond, Va.</p>
  <p align="left"> </p>
  <p align="left">Still unhappy, he returned to the family business in the summer 
    of 2000. He is now a vice president for sales and marketing, and he is enjoying 
    his work. "Once I worked for the attorneys I realized it doesn't matter who 
    your bosses are, you're not always going to like them," Mr. Reynolds said. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">He said his parents welcomed his return. "They hadn't realized 
    that I was an asset to them, and now they do," he said. </p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Reynolds is among many young people who have decided to 
    work at family-owned businesses. Some have grown disenchanted with the outside 
    business world. Others have been forced to return after receiving pink slips 
    or watching their new- economy dreams disintegrate, experts on family companies 
    say. </p>
  <p align="left">Nearly 90 percent of American businesses are family owned or 
    controlled, according to the Institute for Family-Owned Business at the University 
    of Southern Maine. (Among them are big-name companies like Cargill, Anheuser-Busch, 
    Levi Strauss, Gap and Hallmark Cards.) Yet only 30 percent of the family-owned 
    businesses in the country survive into the second generation, 13 percent into 
    the second and fewer than 3 percent into the third, the institute said.Whether 
    the influx of adult children to family businesses will have a long-lasting 
    effect on the companies remains to be seen. "I don't know where it's going 
    to come out, but it's an interesting time," said Fredda Herz Brown, managing 
    partner of the Metropolitan Group, a consulting firm in Tenafly, N.J., that 
    works with family businesses. "It's so dependent on the economy and what's 
    happening in particular industries. There's such tremendous, rapid change." 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Many young people who come from families that own businesses 
    return to the fold after a few years in the outside world, said Ann Dugan, 
    founder and executive director of the Family Enterprise Center at the Katz 
    Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. </p>
  <p align="left">"Even though what they say is one thing, when they see what 
    the reality is in the outside world in terms of salaries and status and perks, 
    they usually reconsider," she said. "Also, as they get older, people understand 
    that they really do want to make a contribution to the family business — that 
    usually the family name is somehow affiliated with it, if not on the name 
    of the business itself. And there is sort of a pride and ego that kicks in 
    at that point as well." </p>
  <p align="left">Although many adult children, like Mr. Reynolds, had once said 
    they would never work for the family — fearing that it would be nepotistic 
    or a sign of personal weakness — they are finding it necessary to return to 
    the nest. Still others wish that their parents had a nest they could return 
    to. </p>
  <p align="left">Bill Shapiro, the founding editor in chief of MBA Jungle, a 
    magazine for aspiring young executives, said he thought that nepotism was 
    slowly losing its stigma. In fact, he included a favorable article about nepotism 
    in the magazine's September issue. "Nepotism makes good business sense; you 
    probably feel more pressure to perform if Dad is signing your paycheck and 
    your family name is on the company stationery," he said in an interview. "Also, 
    relatives are often more efficient in their daily dealings. Relatives perceive 
    one another's thoughts and emotions so viscerally and so quickly that an arched 
    eyebrow or nervous tapping of the pen can take the place of a three-page memo." 
    Company loyalty is also a factor for those joining the family business. </p>
  <p align="left">"Everybody at the company — from the board of directors to management 
    to the line employees — knows that you're not going to leave the firm and 
    go to the competition for a fatter paycheck," Mr. Shapiro added. Joining the 
    family business is also a chance to reconnect with family members, as Patrick 
    Amori is learning. In March 2000, Mr. Amori, 29, left his job as an advertising 
    account executive to help his father run Il Covo Dell'Est, an Italian restaurant 
    in the East Village in Manhattan. Although he had earned a decent salary as 
    an account executive and had many people working for him, "it wasn't what 
    I wanted to do," said Mr. Amori, who is now the restaurant manager. </p>
  <p align="left">"I wanted to see what my father does every day; I wanted to 
    see a side that was different from what I saw as a kid, when he would work 
    all day and come home at night tired," he said. "Now I'm able to be part of 
    his life and try to do good for the family." </p>
  <p align="left">Others have also found their experience rewarding. Melissa Wilson, 
    24, had never imagined working at Tito's Tacos, the taco stand started 43 
    years ago by her great- grandfather in Culver City, Calif. It now employs 
    70 people. "My family is a bunch of entrepreneurs, and I felt like it would 
    be the easy way out if I worked for them," she said of her initial hesitation 
    to join the company. "Plus, the business has caused lots of problems in the 
    family because it was so successful — people fighting about who's going to 
    inherit it." </p>
  <p align="left">Two years ago, during the Internet boom, she graduated from 
    the University of San Francisco with a degree in international relations and 
    took a position as a Bay Area office manager at Icon Medialab, a Swedish company 
    that helps businesses develop Internet marketing strategies. She said she 
    received incentives including a high salary, overseas training classes, four-week 
    vacations and promises of a promotion.</p>
  <p align="left"> But as the months unfolded, it became clear that she was not 
    going to be promoted as quickly as she had hoped. Her peers were being laid 
    off, she said, and she felt she was in a dead-end job. So she quit and looked 
    for new work, living off credit cards and saddling herself with $10,000 in 
    debt. The only available jobs were other office-manager positions, which she 
    did not want. Finally, she began working as a manager at the taco stand last 
    April. Much to her surprise, she said, she is happy. </p>
  <p align="left">"I have the freedom to do things here I wanted to do at my dot-com 
    and didn't realize I could do at a restaurant," she said. "I'm in a management 
    position at the most famous taco stand in Southern California, making more 
    money than I could ever have dreamed." </p>
  <p align="left">Having relatives as bosses can be difficult, she conceded, because 
    it can be hard to separate business from family. But mostly, she added, "it's 
    a blessing in disguise." </p>
  <p align="left">Ira Bryck, director of the University of Massachusetts Family 
    Business Center in Amherst, Mass., cautions family businesses not to hire 
    newly unemployed relatives just because they worry about their futures. "A 
    family business that's going to grow has to make sure it's hiring based on 
    the needs of the business," said Mr. Bryck, whose own family owned a children's 
    wear store, Barasch's Kidstore, for four generations. </p>
  <p align="left">"The proper thing for the family business to do is a need assessment 
    and say, `Despite the fact that this person is in need, does our business 
    need that member?' " he said. "Family business is not just a place to hide 
    out — it's a place to make contributions, to add your skills and talents. 
    It's important for family members to say: `You're going to have to commit 
    to this company as you would to any company. You're not here to hide out until 
    the economy heals itself.' " </p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Bryck predicted that family businesses in general would 
    undergo many changes in the next 20 years, particularly as family- business 
    owners of the baby boom generation retire. Some will be looking to expand 
    by buying other businesses, and others will be looking to sell. "So there 
    is an opportunity for family members to help grow the business," he said.</p>
  <p align="left"> Many young people say that is exactly what they plan to do. 
    "I want to franchise the company all over the country," Ms. Wilson said of 
    the taco stand. "Then I want to retire." </p>
