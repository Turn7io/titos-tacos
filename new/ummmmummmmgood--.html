      <br>
      When moving to California in 1967at age 15- the first taco that I ever had 
      in my life was a Titos taco(at the little stand on corner of Sepulveda)- 
      and have been going there almost weekly ever since- <br>
      No wonder my kids love Titos tacos- &nbsp;that is all that I craved during 
      each of my four pregnancies. &nbsp;And now, my daughter has repeated history 
      and my three grandsons love Titos also! &nbsp;And the baby granddaughter 
      (8 mo.) loves the beans and rice. <br>
      <br>
      We never complain about the long lines that we have to wait in- because 
      it is definitely well worth it. &nbsp;But, the best time to go is 9 a.m. 
      when you first open. &nbsp;And anytime is time for delicious Titos tacos, 
      burritos and the fantastic salsa!!!! <br>
      <br>
      Keep up the good cooking and thank-you again for making Titos my favorite 
      place to eat! <br>
