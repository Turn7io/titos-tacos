It has taken so long to get back to you.&nbsp; We thank you for sitting down to 
write an email to us.&nbsp; I have seen that posting on epicurious.com, I put it 
on our website (<a href="/">www.titostacos.com</a>).&nbsp; After speaking 
to the owner of the restaurant, he believes it is in our best interest to keep 
the reciepe secret right now.&nbsp; As far as another location, we are not 
planning on opening a restaurant anywhere in the near future.&nbsp; We 
appreciate your business and thank you</font></span></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have a two part question if you are able to 
  answer through this e-mail.&nbsp; First, are there any plans to open another 
  Tito's toward the San Fernando Valley, and second have you ever published your 
  famous salsa recipe.&nbsp; When I looked around the web I found someone in 
  Alaska posting a message about the same on epicurious.com.&nbsp; Thanks in 
  advance. Reina</font></div></blockquote></body></html>
