<div><font face="Garamond" size="4">On your web site you asked for info about the 
Zagat Survey (note that it's Zag<u>a</u>t).&nbsp; I don't know if this is the 
reference that you're looking for but I found this site that rates 
Tito's.</font></div>

<div><font face="Garamond" size="4">On a more personal subject, I have been going to 
Tito's since I was in Little League in 1959 or 1960.&nbsp; It would be great to 
learn some of the history of Tito's, the owners, when they moved from the 
Sepulveda corner location, any employees been there since the beginning 
etc.&nbsp; Has there been a story or article that covers all this kind of 
stuff?&nbsp; I live up in Monterey County now but I still have friends and 
family that are regulars and I visit whenever I'm down your way.</font></div>
