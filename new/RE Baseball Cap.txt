Yes we sell hats here at the restaurant.  If I sent this email to late (sorry I just came back from vacation)let me know, I can arrange for a hat to get to you in New York.  Sorry there are no  branches going up anywhere, we are still just one small taco stand.  Thanks for thinking of us...

Do you have baseball caps? My son is in Los Angeles on business. I know I 
could get him to swing by and pick one up for me. I brought him there one 
when he was very young. It was the last time I was there before I had to move 
back east. I can still taste your excellent burritos!

Please let me know and I'll contact him. Say, how about a branch in New York 
City!

All the best, Victor
