Hello:

I have been eating at your great place for 25 years! I love it! I have an
offer to make you! This is the offer:

1. I will make you a new web page complete with pictures.
2. I will pay the hosting fee.
3. I will maintain it at my own cost.
4. I will update it for no payment.

In return, you let me, my wife and two sons eat at no charge at your great
place! No charges will ever be sent to you for keeping your web page going.
I go the Tito's 2 times per month (not  everyday). I think it would be a
good deal for all involved? Please let me know.

Regards,

Walter Hall
