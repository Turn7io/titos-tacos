Happy New Year to everyone at Tito's ... 

How long before we can Have Tito's in the San Fern Valley... 

There is a big market for it.. especially in my neighborhood... Studio City 
... 
We do not have a quick - eatery Like Tito's here... 

I grew up knowing Tito's (as far back as its original location, the corner 
where Lucy;s is or was) every week my dad would take me over to Tito's for a 
taco or two.. 
Luv em... Love the burritos too (Yummy - actually the best I ever had)  

When I mention the best taco's in Los Angeles ... everyone knows its Tito's 
... Ive taken many of folks who have never experienced Tito's and state the 
same... the prices are the best .. the food is fantastic.. 

There is nothing like Tito's in Los Angeles...

There is only one  problem... we want a Tito's in the valley... 

So.. with that said... how soon can we have Tito's in the valley? 

Sincerely... 

Bobby B
